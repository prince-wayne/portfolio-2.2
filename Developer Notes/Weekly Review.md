### The First entry (multiple weeks)

We basically got the home page to load, as raw as capable and we are now breaking it down and debugging compondent to compondent, (leaving from break, finsihing once off hopefully);

That didn't happen; we went homw but basically all the changes has been bug fixes and a few preload render holds. (please wait until load type messages or errors)
