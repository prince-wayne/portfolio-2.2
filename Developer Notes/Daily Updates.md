### What I worked on
    This was day one, I needed to see if the code would function, why it wasn't, and what my opitons were. 

### Problems Fixed
    None, not directly, we need to transfer our files from the original to see if it boots (opens and runs)

### Solutions
    Transfer or Rebuild, our files should work in theory if they're moved to this version. 
### Next Steps
   -  to repeat ourselves one more time. Transfer or rebuild. One by one to find where our project loses support, as in indivual compondents. 
   - Attempt to remove the unsupported files to see if we can get it to run.
